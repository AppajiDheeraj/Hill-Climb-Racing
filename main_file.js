# 🏁 Hill Climbing Race Controller (Hand Gesture Based)

Control the gas and brake of your favorite hill climbing game using just your hand gestures!  
This real-time hand gesture-based controller uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to detect open/closed hand states and triggers keyboard inputs accordingly via **PyAutoGUI**.

## 🎮 Game Controls (Hill Climb Racing)

| Gesture        | Action Triggered |
|----------------|------------------|
| ✋ All Fingers Open | Accelerate (Gas Pedal) |
| ✊ Fist (All Fingers Closed) | Brake (Reverse) |

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Uses **MediaPipe Hands** to detect hand landmarks.
- Detects whether fingers are open or closed based on relative positions.
- Maps:
  - Open hand → `Right Arrow` key (gas)
  - Closed fist → `Left Arrow` key (brake)
- Visual feedback is provided on the video feed with clear UI labels.
